## About Me

I look forward to combining my backround in healthcare with my current studies in computer science to create products that are both patient-centric and user-friendly. In my free time, I play soccer and build keyboards. I am also a black belt in Taekowondo. 


## About My Advisor

Dr. David Knowles is the principal investigator of the Knowles Lab at the New York Genome Center/Columbia University. Dr.Knowles' research involves both the development of novel machine learning methods and their application to data analysis problems in genomics, particularly genetic regulation of the transcriptome.

## About My Project

I will create, train and evaluate a convolutional neural network that employs two dimensional convolution to predict a junction site usage ratio from an input sequence of nucelotides.
